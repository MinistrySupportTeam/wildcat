# Wildcat

*This is a work in progress. Not even nearly 1.0.*

Wildcat is a content management and blogging system written in Ruby that generates static pages.

It is designed to be run locally or on a server. It is designed to be fast.

It can generate websites that *don’t* have a blog — for instance, you could use it to generate the help files for a Mac or iOS app. But its main use is for sites with a blog.

It will generate RSS and JSON Feed as well as HTML pages. It will support the MetaWeblog API and perhaps others.

I’m not looking for pull requests yet. Some time in the future, yes, absolutely.

Note: if the Ruby seems weird anywhere, please let me know. I’m a Swift and Objective-C developer trying to get good at Ruby, but realizing I have a long way to go. :)
